no, he's merely  \u201cpatrolling\u201d the room. when strickland isn't looking, marty produces a matchbook  and a rubber band from the pencil pouch  of his lease leaf binder. he opens the matchbook  cover and sticks his gum to the backside. he waits for strickland to walk past him, then quickly, marty stands and, using the rubber band,  fires the matchbook at the ceiling. strickland whirls around upon hearing the snap, but marty is already seated, \u201cstudying.\u201d strickland  looks around suspiciously, but sees nothing. he continues along. marty glances up: the gum is holding the matchbook  on the ceiling, right near the sprinkler valve.  he smiles. now marty sets his mirrored sunglasses  on his leg positioning them to reflect the rays of the sun  up at the matchbook. that done, he pulls the lens out of his pocket and focuses the beam onto the matchbook. he adjusts  the lens ever so slightly.   there! perfect! a hot white pinpoint of light is focused on the matchbook. mr. strickland returns to his paper grading. he marks an entire set of answers wrong and puts \u201cf\u201d  at the top of a paper. the next paper has two right. strickland gives it an \u201cf+.\u201d marty continues holding the lens as steady as he can, watching anxiously for results. above there  is a faint trace of smoke on the matchbook. the clock now reads 3:37. strickland grades his last paper, then stands up and starts pulling down the window shades! marty is horrified! strickland is 3 shades away from marty\u2019s window. marty looks anxiously up at  the matchbook. marty (under his breath) come on, come on ! strickland pulls down the next shade. there is more smoke from the matchbook  marty burn, you sucker ! strickland pulls down another shade. the next one is marty\u2019s  strickland steps toward it  suddenly the matchbook ignites! fire! immediately  the fire alarm sounds and the sprinklers  go off! marty fire!!! students jump up and scream as water sprays all over them! they rush for the door. marty grabs the  kid with the skateboard, named weeze. marty weeze \u2014 let me borrow this! i\u2019ii bring it back tom orrow! marty takes the skateboard  and dashes out. mr. strickland stop! wait! we must file out in an orderly fashion! another sprinkler goes off and sprays strickland right in the face! 6          ext. hill valley high school \u2014 day                                                                                 6 it's a classic wpa style high school, built in the 1930\u2019s. marty dashes out, jumps on the  skateboard, and skateboards  down the front steps! 7          ext. hilly residential street \u2014 day                                                                               7 marty comes from around the corner, skateboards down a hill, weaving through traffic. he  skateboards like a champ. 8         ext. street \u2014  tow n square \u2014 day                                                                                 8 this is hill valley, a northern california town; it's october. the town has been here a while \u2014 and  its town square business district is beginning to deteriorate  undoubtedly because there's a mall  someplace. the old courthouse, now the department of social services, has a clock tower \u2014 but the clock is  stopped at 10:02. a time and temperature  clock on the bank reads 3:43. marty skateboards down the business street and across traffic, narrowly missing being hit by a car! 9          int. ymca \u2014 stage \u2014 day                                                                                                      9 3 members of the pinheads rock band, keyboards, bass and drums, exchange nervous glances,  repeatedly checking their watches. they\u2019 re all set up on stage. suzy parker is also here \u2014 but she's not part of the band. suddenly, marty skateboards onto the  stage. suzy marty! marty gives her a wink; she smiles. marty's guitar, amp and microphone have already been set up for him. he picks up the guitar and tun  es up, then looks over at suzy. suzy smiles and holds up her crossed fingers. marty grins back. clearly, they\u2019re \u201can item.\u201d marty practices a riff and he's great. you can't tell where the guitar ends and the man begins.  he turns and addresses the dance committee. marty all right, we\u2019re the pin heads, an d we\u2019re gonna rock \u2018n roll! they kick into a red hot number. marty\u2019s fingers dance across the strings and frets in a  complicated lead line. he's terrific, and the band sounds great. they get only about 25 seconds into the number when a voice calls out. dance committeeman that's enough. thank you. marty and the group stop playing, exchanging bewildered glances.

how'd you get beaned? brown well, i was trying to\u2014 (stops short,  thinking better of it)  well, it's not important. what is  important is that it works. it's taken me over 30 years to fulfill the vision of that night. he faces the delorean proudly. marty heavy duty, doc. and it runs on, like, regular unleaded gasoline?
